# Data Structures Algorithms
## Overview
This repository is a collection of open-source implementation of a variety of data structures algorithms implemented in Python. These algorithms span a variety of topics from computer science, data science, engineering, etc.. The implementations and the associated documentation are meant to provide a learning resource for educators and students. Hence, one may find more than one implementation for the same objective but using a different algorithm strategies and optimizations.
